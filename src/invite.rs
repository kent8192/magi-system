//! Invite-based onboarding flow for the `magi` CLI.
//!
//! This module implements the lifecycle of team invitations, which is how a new
//! agent gains access to an existing team. The flow has four user-facing stages,
//! each backed by a CLI command and a `*_with_url` worker function that talks to
//! Redis directly (so they can be reused and unit-tested without re-loading config):
//!
//! - `create`: an owner mints a single-use-style invite for a team and prints the
//!   secret token. The token is shown only once; only its SHA-256 hash is stored.
//! - `list`: enumerate the invites that belong to a team for inspection.
//! - `revoke`: invalidate an outstanding invite so its token can no longer be used.
//! - `join`: a new agent redeems an invite token, atomically consuming it and
//!   registering itself as a member of the invite's team.
//!
//! # Security model
//!
//! The raw invite token is never persisted. At creation time only its hash (see
//! `token_hash`) is written to Redis, and a short-lived lookup key maps that hash
//! back to the owning invite record. Redemption (`join_with_url`) re-hashes the
//! presented token, looks up the invite, and runs a server-side Lua script
//! (`lua/consume_invite.lua`) so that validity checks (revoked / expired / max-uses)
//! and the usage-count increment happen as a single atomic operation, preventing
//! races between concurrent redeemers.
//!
//! # Redis key layout
//!
//! Keys are derived from `RedisKeys`:
//! - `<team>:invite:<invite_id>` — a hash holding the invite's metadata.
//! - `<team>:invites` — a set of all invite ids belonging to the team.
//! - the token-lookup key from `RedisKeys::invite_token` — a TTL-bounded string
//!   mapping a token hash to its invite record key, used for redemption.
