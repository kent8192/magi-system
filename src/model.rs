//! Core data models for the magi messaging system.
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental types used throughout the codebase:
//!
//! - `RedisKeys` — a factory for all Redis key strings used by magi, ensuring
//!   consistent naming across streams, pub/sub channels, agent registrations,
//!   invite tokens, and team metadata.
//! - `AgentIdentity` — the serializable identity of a connected agent (name +
//!   team), stored in Redis and exchanged during the onboarding handshake.
//! - `MessageEvent` — a single message payload written to a Redis Stream entry
//!   and delivered to recipient agents.
//!
//! All user-supplied strings that appear in Redis key segments are sanitised by
//! `encode_key_segment` before use, so colons and other special characters
//! cannot corrupt the key hierarchy.

/// The top-level namespace prefix shared by every Redis key that magi creates.
///
/// All keys follow the pattern `magi:<category>:<team_id>[:<sub_key>]`.
/// Using a common prefix makes it easy to inspect or flush magi state without
/// touching unrelated keys in a shared Redis instance.
pub const REDIS_KEY_PREFIX: &str = "magi";

/// A scoped key-builder for all Redis keys that belong to a given team.
///
/// Construct a `RedisKeys` instance once per operation with the target

/// on construction so that special characters (colons, spaces, etc.) cannot
