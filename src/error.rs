//! Crate-wide error type and `Result` alias for `magi`.
//!
//! All fallible operations in `magi` return `Result<T>`, which is a type
//! alias for `std::result::Result<T, MagiError>`.  `MagiError` collects
//! every category of failure that can arise across the CLI: I/O, Redis
//! connectivity, TOML configuration parsing/serialization, bad configuration
//! values, missing resources, and subprocess failures.
//!
//! Conversions from the underlying library error types are derived
//! automatically via `#[from]` attributes on the enum variants, so callers
//! can use the `?` operator directly without manual `map_err` calls.
