//! Watch mode: streaming output of incoming messages.
//!
//! This module implements the `magi watch` command, which keeps a long-running
//! connection to Redis and prints every new message addressed to the active agent
//! as it arrives.  Output can be formatted either as a compact human-readable
//! line (`WatchFormat::Line`), as machine-parseable NDJSON (`WatchFormat::Json`),
//! or as an agent-context line (`WatchFormat::Context`).
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! 1. A Pub/Sub subscription is opened on the team-scoped Redis channel
//!    (see `RedisKeys::pubsub`).  Senders publish a wakeup notification to this
//!    channel each time a new message is appended to the shared Stream.
//! 2. A 5-second fallback ticker ensures that messages are never missed even if
//!    a wakeup notification is dropped (e.g. due to a transient network hiccup).
//! 3. On each wakeup (or tick), `messaging::read_inbox_with_url` drains all
//!    unread messages from the agent's inbox slice of the Redis Stream and marks
//!    them as consumed.
//! 4. `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) causes a clean exit.
