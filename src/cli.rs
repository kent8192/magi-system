//! Command-line interface definition for the `magi` CLI tool.
//!
//! This module uses `clap` to declare every subcommand, flag, and argument
//! that `magi` accepts.  It is purely declarative — no business logic lives
//! here.  After `clap` parses `argv`, the resulting `Cli` value is handed
//! off to `main` (or a dispatcher in `lib.rs`) which routes each `Command`
//! variant to the appropriate handler module (Redis lifecycle, messaging,
//! team management, SSH helpers, installer, etc.).
//!
//! # Top-level structure
//!
//! ```text
//! magi [SUBCOMMAND]
//!   redis   {start|status|stop}
//!   team    {create|list|members}
//!   invite  {create|list|revoke}
//!   join    --invite <TOKEN>
//!   send    <TO> <MESSAGE>...
//!   inbox
//!   history [--team <T>] [--agent <A>]
//!   watch   [--format line|json]
//!   ssh     {start|status|stop}
//!   install
//!   config  {get|set}
//! ```
//!
//! When invoked with no subcommand, `magi` falls back to an interactive REPL
//! (handled by the caller when `Cli::command` is `None`).
