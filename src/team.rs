//! Team membership operations for the `magi` CLI.
//!
//! A *team* groups the CLI AI agents that can message one another. This module
//! owns the lifecycle of teams and their members on top of Redis: creating a
//! team (and registering its initial owner), listing all known teams, listing
//! the members of a team, and registering or refreshing an individual agent's
//! membership.
//!
//! All persistent state lives in Redis under keys derived from `RedisKeys`.
//! The functions here come in two flavours:
//!
//! - High-level entry points (`create`, `list`, `members`) that load the
//!   `AppConfig` from `~/.magi`, resolve the configured Redis URL, and print
//!   human-readable output. These back the corresponding `magi team` CLI
//!   subcommands.
//! - Lower-level `*_with_url` / `*_with_connection` helpers that take an
//!   explicit Redis URL or connection. These contain the actual Redis logic and
//!   are reused by other modules (for example, invite-based onboarding) and by
//!   tests that need to target a specific Redis instance.
//!
//! Membership data is stored across several Redis structures:
//! a global set of team names, a per-team hash of metadata, a per-team set of
//! agent names, a per-agent hash of profile fields, and a per-agent set of
//! `type:project` registration tuples.
