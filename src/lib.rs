//! `magi` — Redis-backed cross-agent messaging library for CLI AI agents.
//!
//! This crate is the root of the `magi` library.  It re-exports every
//! subsystem as a public module so that both the binary entry-point
//! (`src/main.rs`) and integration tests can reach them through a single,
//! stable namespace.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! | Module | Responsibility |
//! |---|---|
//! | `cli` | Clap-based command-line interface definitions and dispatch |
//! | `config` | Runtime configuration (env vars, `~/.magi` state directory) |
//! | `error` | Unified `Error` / `Result` types for the whole crate |
//! | `install` | Binary installer: copies artefacts to `~/.agents/skills/magi/bin/` and `~/.local/bin/` |
//! | `invite` | Invite-code generation and redemption for onboarding new agents |
//! | `messaging` | Core messaging layer: Redis Streams for durable delivery, Pub/Sub for real-time fanout |
//! | `model` | Shared domain types (messages, teams, agents, invite codes) |
//! | `proc` | Managed embedded Redis server lifecycle (spawn, health-check, teardown) |
//! | `redis_client` | Thin async Redis client wrapper used throughout the crate |
//! | `redis_manager` | High-level manager that owns the connection pool and Stream/Pub-Sub multiplexing |
//! | `repl` | Interactive REPL for composing and reading messages at the terminal |
//! | `session_identity` | Runtime session-record identity resolution for concurrent agent sessions |
//! | `ssh` | SSH helpers for tunnelling connections to remote Redis instances |
//! | `team` | Team membership management: join, leave, list members |
//! | `watch` | Watch mode: continuous message tailing with line or JSON output |
