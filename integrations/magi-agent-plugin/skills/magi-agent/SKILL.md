name: magi-agent
description: >-
  Event-driven bridge that turns incoming magi messages into a persistent
  Claude Agent SDK session and auto-replies via the magi CLI. Use when the
  user wants magi messages to drive Claude automatically, asks to run/configure
  the "magi agent", "magi bot", or an autonomous responder over magi, or wants
  the agent to act the moment a message arrives. Triggers on: magi agent, magi
  bot, auto-reply magi, magi 常駐エージェント, 着信で自動応答.

# magi-agent

A long-lived process ("Plan A") that subscribes to the magi message stream and,
the instant a message arrives, feeds its body into a **persistent Claude Agent
SDK conversation** as a new user turn. The assistant's reply is sent back to the
originating agent through the magi CLI. No polling — magi's Redis Pub/Sub wakeup
makes delivery instant.

## Components

- `bin/magi-agentd` — lifecycle controller (`setup|start|stop|restart|status|logs|run`).
- `lib/magi_agent_bridge.ts` — the bridge (TypeScript) built on `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, run directly by Node's native type-stripping.
- `commands/magi-system.md` — the `/magi-system` slash command wrapping the controller.
- `hooks/magi-session-start.sh` — a SessionStart hook that reports the magi system
  state at startup (and optionally boots Redis/bridge via `MAGI_AGENT_AUTOSTART_REDIS`
  / `MAGI_AGENT_AUTOSTART_BRIDGE`). It also spawns an ephemeral, uniquely named
  MAGI agent for the session (`magi agent spawn`) unless `MAGI_AGENT_EPHEMERAL=0`.
- `hooks/magi-session-end.sh` — a SessionEnd hook that despawns the ephemeral
  agent (`magi agent despawn`) and restores the prior `identity.active_agent`.
- Sibling skill `magi-messaging` — manual magi CLI usage (send/inbox/history) in-session.

The Claude Agent SDK is installed into `lib/node_modules` by `setup`; the daemon's
pid and log live under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/magi-agent/`.

## Quick start

```bash
magi redis start                                   # backend must be reachable
magi config set identity.active_agent <you>        # the agent the bridge speaks as
magi config set identity.active_team <team>

/magi-system setup     # one-time: npm installs the Claude Agent SDK into lib/
/magi-system start     # launches the daemon
/magi-system status    # running? identity? recent log
/magi-system stop
```

From another agent, send a message to `<you>` and the bridge replies automatically.

## How conversations are kept

Each remote peer (the `from` field of a message) gets its **own** persistent
`ClaudeSDKClient`, so every counterpart has an independent, continuous
conversation. Clients are created lazily and capped with LRU eviction
(`MAGI_AGENT_MAX_PEERS`). Incoming messages are processed **serially** so each
turn's response boundary is unambiguous.

## Guardrails (important)

- **Loop prevention:** messages where `from == self` are always ignored — without
  this, the agent would answer its own replies forever.
- **Scope:** only messages addressed to you are handled (`MAGI_AGENT_SCOPE=direct`,
  default). Set `team` to also handle messages addressed to the active team.
- **Sender allowlist:** `MAGI_AGENT_ALLOW_FROM=alice,bob` restricts who can drive
  the agent.
- **Tools off by default (enforced):** in the default permission mode the bridge
  installs a deny-by-default `can_use_tool` guard, so any tool not listed in
  `MAGI_AGENT_ALLOWED_TOOLS` is denied immediately — the agent only converses and
  an unattended turn can never hang waiting for interactive approval. Enable tools
  explicitly (see below) only when you trust the senders and understand the risk.

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MAGI_BIN` | `magi` on PATH | Path to the magi binary |
| `MAGI_AGENT_SELF` | `identity.active_agent` | Agent name the bridge speaks as |
| `MAGI_AGENT_TEAM` | `identity.active_team` | Active team (for `team` scope) |
| `MAGI_AGENT_SCOPE` | `direct` | `direct` (to me) or `team` (to me or my team) |
| `MAGI_AGENT_AUTO_REPLY` | `1` | Send the reply back (`0` = process only, no send) |
| `MAGI_AGENT_ALLOW_FROM` | (all) | Comma list of senders allowed to drive the agent |
| `MAGI_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | built-in | System prompt for the responder |
| `MAGI_AGENT_ALLOWED_TOOLS` | (none) | Comma list of tools to enable (opt-in) |
| `MAGI_AGENT_PERMISSION_MODE` | `default` | SDK permission mode. In `default` the deny-by-default tool guard is active; an explicit mode (`acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, …) disables the guard and is the user's opt-in |
| `MAGI_AGENT_MODEL` | SDK default | Model id override |
| `MAGI_AGENT_MAX_REPLY_CHARS` | `4000` | Truncate outgoing replies to this length |
| `MAGI_AGENT_MAX_PEERS` | `8` | Max concurrent persistent peer sessions |
| `MAGI_AGENT_MAX_PENDING` | `100` | Max queued-but-unprocessed messages before the reader pauses (backpressure) |
| `MAGI_AGENT_LOG_BODIES` | `0` | Log message bodies (truncated) for debugging; off by default so the log never persists message contents |
| `MAGI_AGENT_CWD` | `~` | Working directory for the Claude session |
| `MAGI_AGENT_SETTING_SOURCES` | (lean, none) | Comma list of `user,project,local` settings to load; default is none so the bot ignores your global CLAUDE.md |
| `MAGI_AGENT_NODE` | `node` | Node binary used to run the bridge (needs ≥22.18) |
| `MAGI_AGENT_STATE_DIR` | `~/.local/state/magi-agent` | Where the daemon pid/log live |

Enabling tools is unattended automation with real side effects. If you opt in,
prefer a narrow `MAGI_AGENT_ALLOWED_TOOLS` set and a non-interactive
`MAGI_AGENT_PERMISSION_MODE` (the daemon cannot answer interactive prompts).

## Troubleshooting

- `start` fails immediately → run `/magi-system status` and read the log tail; usual
  causes are `identity.active_agent` unset or `magi redis status` unreachable.
- No replies → check scope/allowlist, and confirm the sender isn't your own agent
  name (self-messages are ignored by design).
- Verify the SDK loop in the foreground with `/magi-system run` (Ctrl-C to stop).
